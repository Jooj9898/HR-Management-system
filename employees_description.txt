The data pertain to employees of a company, one employee per row.

The following attributes are listed for each employee:
id - unique employee id (integer, integer, valid values > 0)
firstName - employee's first first_name (string, any non-empty values are valid)
surname - employee's surname (string, any non-empty values are valid)
email - employee's email (string, any valid email is allowed)
area - the domain in which the employee works (string, valid values: "admin", "business", "technical")
isManager - indicates if the employee is a manager (boolean)
managerId - the employee id of this employer's manager (integer, valid values >= 0)
salary - employee's salary in thousands (integer)

Note: Managers can either (1) manage non-managers, in which case they are called first-line managers, or (2) they can manage first-line managers, in which case they are called second-line. The managerId of second-line managers is set to 0, as they are not managed by an employee on the list.
